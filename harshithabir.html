<h1>BANGARAM</h1>

<div class="message">
    🌸💛🎉 Happy Birthday Pandhi 🥳💛🌸
My dearest bangaram,
WISH YOU A VERY VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! 🥳🎂💫
On this special day, I want you to know just how precious you are to me. Words will never be enough, but I’ll still try — because you deserve the world 💛✨
From the day you sat beside me in 8th class and said,
"Can you share the book?" 📖
to now sharing every little thing in our lives —
that was the beginning of a beautiful, unbreakable bond 🫶
You may not realize this, but that small moment started one of the most beautiful friendships of my life. I still remember the awkward smile, the nervous tone — and look where we are now. From classmates to soul-level best friends 🥹🤍
You’ve been my diary 📒, my comfort 🧸, my laughter 😂, my tears 😢, my strength 💪, and my home 🏡.
There were so many times I couldn’t explain what I was feeling... but you understood.
There were moments I was broken... and you stood beside me, silently holding my heart.
You’ve cried with me, laughed till our stomachs hurt, and stayed even when I pushed you away.
You never gave up on me — and that means more than you’ll ever know. 🥺💕
Do you remember how many times I’ve cried for you back in school?
I cried not because you hurt me, but because you meant that much.
You’re that part of my life I never want to lose. Even now, my heart feels the same — I just don’t always say it.
But if there’s one person I’d protect with my soul — it’s YOU. 🤍🥹
Sorry for not always picking up your calls ☎️
Sorry if I ever said something that hurt 😔
But please know — I’ve never taken you for granted.
I’ve always felt lucky to call you mine 💞
When you share your feelings in detail, even the tiniest ones — I can’t explain how happy I feel 🥹. It makes me feel like I matter, like I’m still your safe space 💫
Please, never cry for anyone — not even for me.
If life gets tough, if people leave, if everything falls apart — I’LL BE THERE.
Right beside you. No matter what. Right or wrong — I’ll always be YOUR person.
Andhulo doubt ledu 🙏💯
Em ayina sare, nen unna. Ni pakkane unna.
Ni smile protect cheyyadam naa responsibility 😌🛡️
💃 One of my favorite memories? Practicing dance for farewell and performing together on stage.
Every beat, every mistake, every step — it was perfect because we did it together.
I’ll never forget that moment. NEVER. 💃✨
And you know what? That’s just the beginning.
I want more of that. More memories. More laughter. More "us".
Let’s grow old together still being crackpots, still sharing memes, still being the jealous-worthy duo everyone wishes they had 🧓👵💖
At the end of this long letter, here’s what I truly want to say:
YOU are the most important person in my life
YOU are my soul best friend
YOU are irreplaceable
And I love you more than I can ever show 🫶💛
Thank you for being YOU.
Thank you for choosing me.
Thank you for staying — always 💐💫
Happy Birthday once again, Pandhi 🥳💛🎂
May your life be filled with happiness, strength, and only real people.
May all your dreams come true 🌈
May your heart always feel safe and loved — especially by me 🥺💖
Love you sooooooooooooooooooo much 😘😘😘
Forever yours,
Your bestest friend till the end of time 💌👭
